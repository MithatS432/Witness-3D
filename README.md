# Witness-3D
A game where we run and jump from platforms

Controls:a,w,s,d, space to jump, leftshift to run and W to wall run

What I want to try is to measure optimization using lots of buildings and probuilders and use about 50 enemies (tigers)

For AI, I only wanted to look at the pursuit and pathfinding algorithms.

Movement: Seek and Pursuit and Pathfinding: A*, Dijkstra, Greedy Best-First Search, NavMesh((Unity Built-in))
